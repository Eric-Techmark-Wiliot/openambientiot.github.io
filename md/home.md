## What is Ambient IoT ?

Ambient “to exists or is present on all sides” when applied to the Internet of Things, connects “things” to the cloud using 
technologies that are ubiquitous, sustainable, very low cost, and very small.  The latest state of the art Ambient IoT 
uses battery-free postage-stamp sized compute devices that power themselves by harvesting energy from radio waves, with 
active radios that push secure sensing and identity data from everyday things like clothes, food, medicine, packaging to the 
wireless devices that surround us, phones, smart speakers, smart cameras, Wi-Fi access points and electronic shelf labels. 

## Not the Internet of Expensive Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept that has existed for decades but it has devolved into something much more limited 
than the original vision.  What we have up until now is an Internet of Expensive things.  IoT devices tend to be focused 
on connecting big expensive things like cars, appliances, gas meters and phones.  Protocols like NB-IoT & Redcap, even Lora 
WAN require relatively large expensive devices that typically require batteries to operate.

Other technologies like RFID use much smaller and cheaper tags, but require expensive bulky infrastructure.  The devices required 
to read RFID tags cost thousands of dollars and so are sparsely deployed, limited in their visibility and often require manual labor 
to “wield them”.  Rather like the original plate cameras, they take a snapshot of “things” and the intelligence is monochrome.  
 There is no sensing and the security predates the internet where privacy and data ownership[ are table stakes.

## A New Generation of Internet of Every-Single-Thing Technologies
The original IoT concept is reawakening now because technology advances and a new wave of industry standards are enabling IoT tags that cost pennies. 

The latest operation devices use Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate but in the future there will be other standards that compete to fill in the gaps.
   3GPP, the organization that defines 5G and 6G is working on supporting “Ambient IoT” in Release 19 of what will be 
called 5G Advanced and then 6G.  The IEEE is in early stages of working on a future edition of 802.11 that will offer 
another alternative and the Bluetooth SIG is not standing still.

## Why invest your limited time into Ambient IoT ? 
The potential to drastically improve our industries when you “turn the lights on” and suddenly enable visibility of every 
product, tool, raw materials, work in progress and finished goods will spawn thousands of new businesses.  It will challenge 
encumbants to retain their position in the face of disruption.

As well as major new sources of profit, we have the opportunity to address some of society’s major problems: climate change 
(eliminating waste, optimizing efficiency, delivering real time carbon footprint visibility).  The productivity increases 
can help us support the “grey wave” of retiring baby boomers, and with real-time visibility of every asset of value we can tackle a 
lot of theft, counterfeit and grey market issues that place a burden on societies.

## Why we started an Open Ambient IoT Project ?
With something this big no company can do it all on their own.  The applications span every industry.  
 The challenges and opportunities require the combined creativity and intelligence of a huge ecosystem.  

We believe the best way to make progress is to share and build on each others ideas.  That’s what open source has proven to do best.  

We all have much more to gain by helping each other than focusing on grabbing market share.  
 Consider the size of the internet when the connection between the cloud and the physical world has been constrained to a 
few billions of devices. Ambient IoT opens up an Internet of Trillions and it will require an open sharing of ideas and 
tools to make the most of it.
