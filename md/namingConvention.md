### General Guidelines for naming OpenAmbientIoT Open Source Projects

When naming open source projects, it's important to choose a name that is descriptive, concise, and easy to remember. Here are some general guidelines to follow:

* Use lowercase letters and dashes to separate words. Avoid using spaces, underscores, or uppercase letters in the name.

* Choose a name that reflects the purpose or functionality of the project. The name should be descriptive and easy to understand for potential users and contributors.

* Avoid using trademarks, company names, or other protected terms in the name, unless you have permission to do so.

* Check for existing projects with similar names on GitHub and other repositories to avoid confusion and potential trademark issues.



### Naming Convention for Wiliot Projects
All Wiliot-specific projects should start with the name wiliot-. After that, the name should be descriptive and concise, using lowercase letters and dashes to separate words. You can also include a programming language or technology convention at the end of the name, separated by a dash. For example:

* wiliot-js-sdk: a JavaScript software development kit for Wiliot devices

* wiliot-py-sdk: a Python software development kit for Wiliot devices

* wiliot-mqtt-demo: a demo project for using MQTT with Wiliot devices
