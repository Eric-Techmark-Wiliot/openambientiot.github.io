# General Guidelines for naming OpenAmbientIoT Open Source Projects

When naming open source projects, it's important to choose a name that is descriptive, concise, and easy to remember. Here are some general guidelines to follow:

1. Use lowercase letters and dashes to separate words. Avoid using spaces, underscores, or uppercase letters in the name.

2. Choose a name that reflects the purpose or functionality of the project. The name should be descriptive and easy to understand for potential users and contributors.

3. Avoid using trademarks, company names, or other protected terms in the name, unless you have permission to do so.

4. Check for existing projects with similar names on GitHub and other repositories to avoid confusion and potential trademark issues.



# Naming Convention for Wiliot Projects
All Wiliot-specific projects should start with the name wiliot-. After that, the name should be descriptive and concise, using lowercase letters and dashes to separate words. You can also include a programming language or technology convention at the end of the name, separated by a dash. For example:

- wiliot-js-sdk: a JavaScript software development kit for Wiliot devices
- wiliot-py-sdk: a Python software development kit for Wiliot devices
- wiliot-mqtt-demo: a demo project for using MQTT with Wiliot devices
