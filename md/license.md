# LICENSE

## Wiliot-Specific Projects

For all Wiliot-specific projects, we recommend using the `MIT` or `ISC` license. These licenses are permissive and allow for the software to be used, modified, and distributed with few restrictions.

The MIT license is a widely-used and well-understood license that allows for both commercial and non-commercial use, as well as modification and distribution. The ISC license is a simplified version of the MIT license that is even more permissive and has fewer legal obligations.

When using the MIT or ISC license for a Wiliot-specific project, please include the license text at the beginning of your project's source code.

## OpenAmbientIoT Open Source Project

For the openambientiot open source project, we encourage developers to choose an appropriate license based on the needs of their project. There are many different types of licenses available, ranging from permissive to restrictive, and it's important to choose a license that aligns with the goals and values of your project.

Some commonly used licenses for open source projects include the Apache License, the GNU General Public License, and the Mozilla Public License. Each of these licenses has its own terms and requirements, so be sure to read and understand the license before using it for your project.

When choosing a license for your `OpenAmbientIoT` project, consider the following factors:

- How permissive or restrictive do you want your license to be?

- Will your project be used in commercial or non-commercial settings?

- Do you want to require attribution for your work?

- Do you want to require derivative works to use the same license?

- Do you want to require that users disclose any modifications they make to your work?


By carefully considering these factors and choosing an appropriate license, you can help ensure that your openambientiot project is used, modified, and distributed in a way that aligns with your project's goals and values.

Please include the license text at the beginning of your project's source code, along with any other attribution or copyright notices that are required by the license.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right license is an important step in creating and sharing open source software. By following these guidelines and carefully considering the needs of your project, you can help ensure that your software is used and shared in a way that aligns with your goals and values.
